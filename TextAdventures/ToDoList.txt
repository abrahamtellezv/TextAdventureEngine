PROBLEMS!!!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There's some klind of problem with take all when there's only one item in the room.
FIXED - When taking the ball and dropping it in a room. It doesnt appear on the room description. It is still there, and if you pick it up
	again and drop it, now it WILL show in the description....
	SOLUTION - The thing was that the propery showfirstencounterdescription was set to true, but it lacked one, and taking an item OUT of a container didnt yet mark it as false.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make it so that when the keywords for an item are read, we remove all instances of the word "the" from the read keyword.
	This way things could have names like "the book of the dead" and, even tho the parser would turn the search keywords to "book of dead"
	If the keywords read are also parsed that way the would still match
