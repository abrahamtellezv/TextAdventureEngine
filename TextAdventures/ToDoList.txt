NOS QUEDAMOS EN ESTO:



TO DO:
Make it so that when the keywords for an item are read, we remove all instances of the word "the" from the read keyword.
	This way things could have names like "the book of the dead" and, even tho the parser would turn the search keywords to "book of dead"
	If the keywords read are also parsed that way the would still match
